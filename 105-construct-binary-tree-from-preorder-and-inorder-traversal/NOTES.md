 pre order = [3,9,20,15,7]
 inorder = [9,3,15,20,7]
 Firt element of the preorder is always the root so 3 is the root
 then we know that 9 is the left of the tree and 15/20/7 is the right of the tree
 so we divide the preorder [9] left  [20,15,7] right
 and so on and so forth..
 Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
